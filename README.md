# Inclined-borehole-in-an-anisotropic-rock-formation
This program provides the analytical solution to borehole stress concentrations around boreholes drilled at an arbitrary orientation in an anisotropic rock formation.  The input parameters include: borehole orientation, far-field stress orientation, borehole fluid pressure, elastic constants and orientation of the rock medium. This code was developed as part of a soon to be published paper "A PROGRAM TO CALCULATE THE STATE OF STRESS IN THE VICINITY OF AN INCLINED BOREHOLE THROUGH AN ANISOTROPIC ROCK FORMATION" in the journal Geophysics. A MATLAB version is also available in the paper.
This program is is also used in a discussion in my thesis "A True-Triaxial Laboratory Seismic Velocity Experiment Under In Situ Stress Conditions: A Comparison With In Situ 3D Stress and Velocity". Here it is shown how considering anisotropy in borehole breakouts in a deep mine in Sudbury, Ontario is an improvment from the usual isotropic assumption made in stress measurements. Additionally, how this anistropic analytical solution can optimize the amount of usable data that can be collected from one borehole, helping to constrain borehole breakout stress measurements in mines.
